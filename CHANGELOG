v0.4.0
------

* Add support for multiple arguments to both the ``tinycontent`` and
  the ``tinycontent_simple`` template tags.
* Require at least django-autoslug 1.8.0, to fix a warning about
  unapplied migrations.

v0.3.0
------

* Drop support for Django 1.4 (it's quite hard to support Django 1.4
  and 1.9 in a single release - since Django 1.4 requires ``{% load
  url from future %}``, and Django 1.9 doesn't support it).
* Ensure the wheel we upload to PyPI is universal.
* Forward compatibility for Django 1.9 - remove the ``{% load url
  from future %}`` from tinycontent templates.

v0.2.1
------

* Forwards compatibility change for Django 1.9 - which will remove
  the version of ``importlib`` bundled with Django. All supported
  versions of Python (2.7, 3.3 and 3.4) have ``importlib``.

v0.2.0
------

* Dropped support for Python 2.6.
* Added a built-in markdown filter - you can use it by setting
  ``TINYCONTENT_FILTER`` to
  ``'tinycontent.filters.md.markdown_filter'``.
* Added the ability to include links to files which you can upload
  via the admin.
* Added support for setting ``TINYCONTENT_FILTER`` to a list of
  dotted paths, to allow chaining filters.

v0.1.8
------

* Added the ``TINYCONTENT_FILTER`` setting for controlling the way
  content is output.
* Improved testing with Travis (we now test all supported Python
  versions and Django versions).
